I literally made this boring thing in few minutes. Credits to ArTicZera and Wipet for HSL, credits to N17Pro3426. I'm not responsible for any damages, this thing only works correctly on Windows XP 32-bit. If you want to use the source code in your malware, you must make your malware open source as well!
